**Generated:** October 19, 2025  
**Project:** Epithelial-Stromal Microenvironment in Early Colonic Neoplasia  
**Lead Investigators:** Dr. Daniel W. Rosenberg, Dr. Charles Giardina, Boyang Li, Takayasu Ideta

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This is a **standalone research project** (NOT part of Bo's PhD thesis) investigating immune-related gene expression changes in aberrant crypt foci (ACF) - the earliest detectable precancerous lesions in colorectal cancer. The study uses laser-capture microdissection and targeted RNA sequencing to profile ~395 immune genes in both epithelial and stromal compartments of dysplastic ACF compared to matched normal tissue from 10 patients.

### Key Findings:
1. **PD1 is the most upregulated gene** in ACF epithelium (FC=-4.24, p<0.001) - validated by immunofluorescence
2. **Chemokine signaling is activated** in both compartments with distinct patterns
3. **Epithelial compartment**: Upregulation of neutrophil chemotaxis genes (CXCL8, CXCL1, S100A8/A9)
4. **Stromal compartment**: Upregulation of CXCL13, CXCR4, and immune regulatory genes
5. **Immune exhaustion markers** suggest early immunosuppression in precancerous lesions

### 1.2 Main Scientific Message

**Central Hypothesis:** Early neoplastic lesions (ACF) exhibit distinct immunological changes in both epithelial and stromal compartments that may predict progression to advanced neoplasia.

**Key Results:**
1. PD1 expression on intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is significantly elevated in ACF epithelium
2. Chemokine-related pathways are activated in both compartments with compartment-specific patterns
3. Epithelial ACF shows upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL1, S100A8/A9)
4. Stromal ACF shows upregulation of CXCL13, CXCR4, and immune checkpoint molecules
5. These changes occur at the earliest stage of neoplasia, suggesting immune dysregulation precedes malignant transformation

### 1.5 Critical Gaps Identified

**Content Gaps:**
1. **Methods section** needs clarification on:
   - Two biological replicates (from same LCM? different extractions?)
   - Exact normalization method (DESeq2 parameters)
   - Multiple testing correction details
   - Why separate analysis of epithelial/stromal samples

2. **Results section** needs:
   - Clearer explanation of why PD1 is "most upregulated" (depends on analysis approach)
   - More detail on chemokine patterns
   - Better integration of epithelial-stromal findings
   - Quantification of immunofluorescence results

3. **Discussion section** needs:
   - Major reorganization and focus
   - Clearer connection to clinical implications
   - Better integration of literature
   - Stronger conclusion about risk stratification

**Statistical Issues:**
1. Some genes mentioned have p-values >0.05 (CXCL9, PECAM1) - needs clarification
2. Inconsistent reporting of fold changes (some from pooled, some from separate analysis)
3. Need to explain why epithelial and stromal analyzed separately

### 3.2 Statistical Methods Details

**DESeq2 Parameters:**
- **Version:** 1.26.0
- **R version:** 3.6.3
- **Design formula:** ~Condition
- **Test:** Wald test
- **Shrinkage:** Likely default (apeglm or normal)
- **Normalization:** Size factors (median of ratios method)
- **Transformation:** VST (variance stabilizing transformation) for PCA
- **Multiple testing:** Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
- **Significance thresholds:**
  - Fold change: >1.5 or <0.67 (log2FC >0.585 or <-0.585)
  - Adjusted p-value: <0.05
  - Detection rate: >50% in upregulated group

**Key Decision: Separate vs Pooled Analysis**
- **Initial approach:** Pooled analysis (all samples together)
- **Final approach:** Separate analysis (epithelial and stromal independently)
- **Rationale:** Different background noise, better fold change estimates
- **Impact:** More genes pass significance threshold, better statistical power

**PCA Parameters:**
- **Input:** VST-transformed counts
- **Gene selection:** Top 50 most variable genes
- **Scaling:** Centered and scaled
- **Analyses performed:**
  1. All samples together (shows compartment separation)
  2. Epithelial only (shows ACF vs Normal)
  3. Stromal only (shows ACF vs Normal)

### 3.3 Key Results Summary

**Epithelial Compartment (ACF vs Normal):**
- **Significant genes:** 113 (64 up, 49 down)
- **Top finding:** PD1 downregulation (actually means upregulation in ACF - confusing terminology)
- **Pathway enrichment:**
  - Neutrophil chemotaxis
  - Chemokine production
  - Leukocyte chemotaxis
  - NF-κB signaling

**Stromal Compartment (ACF vs Normal):**
- **Significant genes:** 93 (54 up, 39 down)
- **Top findings:** CXCL13, CXCR4, immune checkpoint genes
- **Pathway enrichment:**
  - Chemokine-mediated signaling
  - Cell chemotaxis
  - Immune cell recruitment
  - JAK/STAT3 signaling

**Cross-Compartment Observations:**
- Some genes show opposite patterns (e.g., CCR7: up in epithelium, down in stroma)
- Chemokine signaling activated in both but with different genes
- Suggests complex epithelial-stromal crosstalk

---

## 4. BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION

### 4.1 Main Findings

**1. PD1 Expression on Intraepithelial Lymphocytes**
- PD1 is the most significantly upregulated gene in ACF epithelium
- Validated by immunofluorescence: 2.82 ± 0.02 PD1+CD8+ cells per 200 crypt cells in ACF vs 0 in normal
- Suggests early T cell exhaustion and immune evasion
- All samples were microsatellite stable (MSS), ruling out MSI-driven PD1 expression

**2. Chemokine Signaling in Epithelium**
- Upregulated: CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL1, S100A8, S100A9, CCR1
- Function: Neutrophil and macrophage recruitment
- Interpretation: Pro-inflammatory microenvironment
- Clinical relevance: Chronic inflammation promotes tumorigenesis

**3. Chemokine Signaling in Stroma**
- Upregulated: CXCL13, CXCR4, CCR7 (downregulated)
- CXCL13: B cell recruitment, tertiary lymphoid structure formation
- CXCR4: Tumor cell migration, immune evasion, angiogenesis
- Interpretation: Immune microenvironment remodeling

**4. Immune Cell Infiltration**
- Epithelium: Evidence of IEL activation (PD1+CD8+ cells)
- Stroma: Mixed signals - some recruitment markers up, others down
- Suggests complex immune landscape with both activation and suppression

**5. Senescence and Cell Cycle**
- CDKN2A (p16) upregulated in stroma
- Suggests stress-induced senescence
- May represent tumor suppression mechanism
- But senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) could promote progression

### 4.2 Clinical Implications

**Risk Stratification:**
- Proximal ACF with these immune signatures may predict advanced neoplasia
- PD1+ IELs could serve as biomarker for progression risk
- Chemokine profile might identify high-risk lesions

**Therapeutic Implications:**
- Early immune checkpoint activation suggests potential for immunotherapy
- Chemokine targeting could prevent progression
- Anti-inflammatory strategies might be beneficial

**Prevention Strategies:**
- NSAIDs (mentioned: ALOX15B, FCGR3A upregulated)
- Immune modulation
- Microbiome interventions (given immune activation)
