## NOTES & DECISIONS

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. Target journal: Clinical Cancer Research or Cancer Research
2. Timeline: 4-6 weeks to submission
3. Focus: Complete analysis scripts first, then manuscript revision
4. Priority: Reproducibility and documentation

**Outstanding Questions:**
1. What are the two technical replicates? (same LCM or different extractions?)
2. Why are some samples labeled "3E" or "3S"?
3. Should Table 1 (demographics) be in main text or supplementary?
4. Do we have any follow-up data on these patients?

**Next Review Point:** After master script completion
